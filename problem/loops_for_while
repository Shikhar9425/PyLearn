Loops are control structures that iterate over a range to perform a certain task. They can work with any iterable type, such as lists and dictionaries. To control the loop in this problem, use the range function (see below for a description).

There are two kinds of loops in Python.

A for loop:

for i in range(0, 5):
    print i
    
output
0
1
2
3
4
    
And a while loop:

i = 0
while i < 5:
    print i
    i += 1

output
0
1
2
3
4
