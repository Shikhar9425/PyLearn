Given a binary string S consisting of 0s and 1s. The task is to find the maximum difference of the number of 0s and the number of 1s (number of 0s â€“ number of 1s) in the substrings of a string.

Note: In the case of all 1s, the answer will be -1.

Input : S = "11000010001" 
Output : 6 
Explanatio: From index 2 to index 9, 
there are 7 0s and 1 1s, so number 
of 0s - number of 1s is 6.

class Solution:
	def maxSubstring(self, S):
	    ans,count=0,0
	    for c in s:
	        if(c=='0'):
	            count+=1
	            ans=max(ans,count)
	        elif(count>0):
	            count-=1
	    if ans>0:
	       return ans
	        
	    else:
	        return -1
